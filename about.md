## About Me

I'm **Basit Rahim**, a Computer Science graduate from the **Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)**, where I graduated with Distinction and was on the Dean's Honor List for three consecutive years.

I'm currently a **Research Associate at PAMS (Pakistan Alliance for Maths and Science)**, where I design agent-based modeling frameworks to investigate student dropout in Pakistan and simulate policy interventions for government stakeholders. I collaborate with CITY @ LUMS on GIS-based spatial analysis and work at the intersection of computational social science, education research, and data-driven policy design.
